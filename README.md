This repository aims to record analysis information of the [Meta Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggle/meta-kaggle/data), which is Kaggle's public data on competitions, users, submission scores, code, and more.

The visualization of the ERD for the dataset is available [here](https://liambx.com/erd/p/github.com/czhangwt/KaggleMataData/blob/main/ds_DatabaseSchema.sql?showMode=ALL_FIELDS&active=kernelacceleratortypes), which was generated using [Liam ERD](https://github.com/liam-hq/liam)
